      <p>Castle was a tech-powered property management service I cofounded in 2014. We grew to $1mm ARR, got into Y Combinator (W16), and raised $4mm from Khosla Ventures, SV Angel, and Stripe cofounder John Collison, among others.</p>
      
      <p>As CEO, I led product, design, and marketing. I designed (and built the front-end for) the first versions of our product, personally closed our first $200k in ARR, and grew the team from three to 18.</p>
      
      <p>Through our web platform, property owners could track their portfolio&rsquo;s performance; monitor maintenance issues, solicit and compare bids, and approve work requests; market their properties and monitor their tenant pipeline; and control their property&rsquo;s finances. The platform also provided tools for tenants and maintenance providers.</p>
      
      <p>The Castle app was used by ~400 property owners, ~2,000 tenants, ~100 maintenance providers, and tens of thousands of applicants. We measured success of the platform by engagement with the app, reduction in support tickets, and customer satisfaction scores.</p>

      <p>Castle experienced strong growth for a few years, but we were ultimately unable to effectively scale the company&rsquo;s on-the-ground operations. We sold off the brand and some core technology assets and wound down the company in 2018.</p>
