      <p>Are You a Human replaced online annoyances like CAPTCHA and pre-roll video with interactive advertising. I worked there as a Product Designer (employee #9) from 2012&ndash;2014, my first job out of college. The company was acquired by Distil Networks in 2017.</p>
      
      <p>I was responsible for two products at AYAH. PlayThru, our CAPTCHA replacement, turned these annoying things:</p>
      
      <img src="img/captcha.gif" class="centered-image">
      
      <p>into fun mini-games like these:</p>
      
      <div class="face-dominos">
        <img src="img/face-game.png">
        <img src="img/dominos-game.png">
      </div>
      
      <p>The second was PlayThru Video, which displayed an interactive advertisement similar to the Domino's game above over the bottom third of a pre-roll video ad. By interacting with the game, users could skip the ad.</p>
      
      <p>Users were happy because they got to their content faster, and brands were happy because users had actually engaged with their brand instead of passively watching (or not paying attention to) their ad.</p>
      
      <p>We measured success by percentage of users who interacted with the game (94%), click-through rate (45x banner ads), and brand recall (300% boost over traditional advertising).</p>
      
      <p>I played a core role in developing the PlayThru Video product and designed over 50 games for brands like Tide, Jeep, Xbox, and Audi.</p> 
      
      <p>Ultimately, though, the product never really caught on. The company was aqcuired primarily for the value of the behind-the-scenes technology we&rsquo;d developed to tell bots from real people, and both PlayThru products were discontinued shortly thereafter.</p>
